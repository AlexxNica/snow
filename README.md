# Chocolate Jesus

No rustier noise than Tom waits, after all.

A working title for a fork of Screech, the library by @trevp that implements
the Noise protocol.

Implementation of the [Noise Protocol
Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org) in Rust.

Uses [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto) but has pluggable
support for other crypto libraries.

## Status

Work in progress.  All APIs are unstable.  Don't use for security critical
purposes.

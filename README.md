# Screech

Implementation of the [Noise Protocol
Framework](https://github.com/trevp/noise) in Rust.

Uses [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto) but has pluggable
support for other crypto libraries.

## Status

Work in progress.  All APIs are unstable.  Don't use for security critical
purposes.
